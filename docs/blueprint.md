- Body text font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for clear, readable text in the blog content and paragraphs.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif font for a modern, tech-inspired touch in headings.
- Use modern, minimalist icons for social media links and navigation, focusing on readability and sleekness.
- Design a clean, minimal, and elegant layout inspired by corporate blogs like Google Blog or Microsoft News.
- Incorporate smooth, subtle fade-in effects and hover animations to enhance user engagement without being distracting.
